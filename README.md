### Description
Efteling is preparing to open its new attraction, Danse Macabre, a thrilling and mysterious ride where visitors are taken on a ghostly adventure aboard a large rotating platform. Before the real-life attraction is built, Efteling has developed a digital tech demo in Unity.

### Features
- The large central platform must rotate.
- The six smaller seat platforms must rotate independently.
- A lift mechanism must raise the entire platform while it continues to spin.
- A drop mechanism must make the platform suddenly fall while spinning.
- A tilt mechanism must allow the platform to tilt at an angle.
