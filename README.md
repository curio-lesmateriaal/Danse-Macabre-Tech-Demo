# <Case Study: Danse Macabre Tech Demo>

## Description

Client: Efteling
Background
Efteling is preparing to open its new attraction, Danse Macabre, a thrilling and mysterious ride where visitors are taken on a ghostly adventure aboard a large rotating platform. Before the real-life attraction is built, Efteling wants to develop a digital tech demo in Unity.

Your team has been hired to make the 3D model of Danse Macabre, which is already available on GitHub, fully interactive. The model currently consists only of visuals and must be expanded with the correct movements and interactions.
